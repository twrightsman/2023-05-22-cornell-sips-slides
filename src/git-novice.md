# Summary

## The Story

Wolfman and Dracula have been hired by Universal Missions (a space
services spinoff from Euphoric State University) to investigate if it
is possible to send their next planetary lander to Mars. They want to
be able to work on the plans at the same time, but they have run into
problems doing this in the past. If they take turns, each one will
spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish, but if they work
on their own copies and email changes back and forth things will be
lost, overwritten, or duplicated.

## Perhaps version control?

A colleague suggests using version control to manage their
work. Version control is better than mailing files (or Slack!) back
and forth:

::: {.incremental}
- Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless
  you work really, really hard at it. Since all old versions of files
  are saved, it’s always possible to go back in time to see exactly
  who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was
  used to generate a particular set of results.
- As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to
  ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a
  previous version, much like the “undo” feature in an editor.
- When several people collaborate in the same project, it’s possible
  to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone’s changes. The version
  control system automatically notifies users whenever there’s a
  conflict between one person’s work and another’s.

## Not just for teams!

::: {.incremental}
- Researchers can also benefit from version control
    - what did I do a year ago and why?
- It can be a piece of your digital lab notebook
- Not just code, but any text document that changes over time can be
  put into a version control system
    - `git` mostly works with text files, but other systems for binary
      files exist
